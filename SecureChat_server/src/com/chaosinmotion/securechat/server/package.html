<h1>Server</h1>
<p>This package contains all of the servlets which process POST requests
sent by each client to handle logging in, associating a device with each
account, and sending and receiving messages. Each of these classes simply
handle parsing the request; the logic behind each message is then handled
in the server.commands package.</p>
