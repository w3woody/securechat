	 * It's all the rage with kids nowadays to specify each command as its
	 * own URI, but without understanding the limitations imposed by the
	 * HTTP protocol.
	 * 
	 * Get commands are commands that require no arguments, and that return
	 * a value. Downstream caching servers are permitted to cache the value
	 * and re-send the value without hitting our server if the URL matches and
	 * the cache hasn't timed out. Think of it as a file read operation with
	 * the URL being the file read.
	 * 
	 * Put commands are commands which save the contents of a file. Think of
	 * it as a 'write' command with the URL specifying the file being written.
	 * Downstream caching servers may re-send the contents of this file in
	 * response to a GET command with the same URL as the PUT URL just saved.
	 * 
	 * Post commands are similar to executing the program at the URL specified
	 * with the input file provided, and writing the output returned. 
	 * 
	 * We prefer POST over GET and PUT because this accurately represents what
	 * we are doing; we are running commands. Even our random token get
	 * command is a command; we do not want to rely on a downstream caching
	 * server caching the randomly returned token.
