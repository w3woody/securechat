<h1>Commands</h1>
<p>The model I've used for handling server commands is to place each of the
commands themselves into its own class. This should make it easier to
understand what each command actually does on the back-end. The Servlets
contained in the securechat.server package first parses the request, then
passes the request to one of the classes in this package to actually process.</p>
<p>By keeping each command relatively simple this should make a visual
inspection of the functionality of each command straight forward, in order
to make sure this system has not been hacked with a back door.</p>

for more information on how the server works and weaknesses in the protocol.</p>
