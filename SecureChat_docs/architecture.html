		<h1>Architecture</h1>
		<h2>Assumptions</h2>
		<p>No system is 100% secure. The design goal of SecureChat, however, is the following:</p>
		<p class="headnote">Secure all messages end-to-end.</p>
		<p>We use an RSA public/private key system to encode all messages on the client device,
			and transmit only the encrypted message to the server for delivery to the
			destination device. This implies if a user has multiple devices, we will encrypt
			the message multiple times, once for each destination device.</p>
		<p class="headnote">Minimize data on the server</p>
		<p>One method by which an attacker can obtain data is to hack the back-end server. We
			minimize the exposure to an attacker through the following techniques:</p>
		<ul><li>Messages are removed from the server as soon as they are delivered to the
			client. This means the only record of communications is on the user's device, and
			not on the server. If the device is off-line, messages are stored, but only until
			a destination device is brought on-line.</li>
			<li>Minimize the amount of information captured during account setup. In the case
			of SecureChat, the only data captured is a username and password during account
			creation. Resetting the password requires an active device capable of receiving
			messages from the server. Further, there is no 'user discovery' beyond trying to
			chat with a specific user; it is assumed usernames are communicated separately.</li>
			<li>Use randomly generated UUIDs (specifically cryptographically generated version 4
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Version_4_.28random.29">UUIDs</a>)
			in order to identify devices to the server. This reduces the possibility of using
			certain UUID fields (such as network identifiers) in order to back-track a device
			identifier on a back-end server to the specific iOS device being used.</li>
			<li>Assume the database has been compromised by using SHA-256 to encrypt all
			passwords on the back-end server. <i>(Look, this is security 101, and if you are
			not doing this on your design, please do us a favor and switch professions. Become
			an attorney; you'll do less damage.)</i>
			</ul>
		<p class="headnote">Minimize exposure to hacking on the device</p>
		<p>Another method by which an attacker can obtain data is to obtain access to a device.
			We minimize exposure to an attacker through the following techniques:</p>
		<ul><li>Assume the secure keystore on iOS has been compromised by requiring a separate
			passcode to decrypt our own keystore data. Our data is stored encrypted using
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_(cipher)">Blowfish,</a>
			using a key generated from an SHA-256 hash of the entered passcode. We
			further reduce the possibility of a brute-force attack by using a 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check">CRC-8 hash</a>
			to determine if our keystore has been decrypted. <b>This is a deliberate design
			choice, which has the property of creating a 1 in 256 chance of destructively
			destroying data if the wrong passcode is entered.</b> For a weak passcode of 4
			digits, this means it is 39 times more likely a destructive passcode is entered
			than the correct passcode.</li>
			<li>Assume the data in the device is compromised by keeping all messages on the
			device in the same encrypted from received from the server. Messages are decrypted
			only as they are displayed using an in-memory cache.</li>
			<li>Assume the RSA key encryption architecture on iOS has been compromised by
			providing our own RSA encryption system. That system is documented 
			<a href="rsa.html">in a separate section.</a></li>
			<li>Because all messages are encrypted locally on the client, the client must know
			the number of devices a receiver has registered. This number (as well as the
			number of devices registered to you) are displayed at the top of each chat message.
			If that number suspiciously increments, you can check separately with the user
			that he did or did not register a new device, and stop communications 
			immediately.</li></ul>
		</ul>
		<p class="headnote">Minimize exposure to packet sniffing</p>
		<p>A third method is to listen to all network communications, in order to gain
			insight into information that can be used to hack the system. We minimize exposure
			to an attacker through the following techniques:</p>
		<ul><li>Use a two-phase login process where we receive a randomly generated token from
			the server, and use that token to hash the password sent. 
			<a href="http://www.tech-faq.com/apop.html">This technique</a> should make
			it harder to sniff the packet to determine the user's password, and spoof a
			user through using a 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_attack">replay attack.</a></li>
			<li>The design of the system means all messages are sent and received encoded,
			so sniffing for messages should be difficult.</li>
			<li>Deleting messages on the back-end require the correct checksum to be sent to
			verify the receiver did correctly decrypt the message (and thus, is in possession
			of the correct RSA key). This prevents a hacker from destroying unreceived messages
			by spoofing a client caller with sniffed credentials.</li></ul>
		<p>(<b>Note:</b> We do not encrypt the entire message, which is sent as JSON
			POST requests and received as JSON formatted data to an HTTP server. Thus, for 
			additional security you should install the server on a server that uses an
			SSH secured socket. Doing that is beyond the scope of this document.)</p>
		<p>It is worth remembering that SSH by itself does not prevent a 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">Man in the middle attack</a>,
			so it is worth considering designing your protocol as if it were sent 
			in the clear.</p>
	
		
		<h2>Architectural description</h2>
		<h3>Server Overview</h3>
		<p>The SecureChat Server is actually quite simple; it serves as a means by which
			clients advertise their own public key, and for discovering the public key of
			other devices belonging to a given user. Individual users can have multiple
			devices associated with their account. Because the goal is to minimize storage
			on each device, the database itself is quite simple.</p>
		<img class="diagram" src="images/serverdb.png">
		<p>The server database consists of 5 tables total, of which three are actively used.
			(A fourth is used to track requests for forgotten passwords, and a fifth is used
			to track the version of the schema loaded into the database.) These tables give
			the list of users (storing only the username and the hashed password), the list
			of devices owned by each user, and the list of messages that are waiting for 
			delivery to each device. Note that because of the way messages are sent, encoded
			with the public key of each device, a message may show up multiple times for 
			each user. Further, this implies that when a user adds a device to his account,
			he will not have access to his message history for that account. This is a
			deliberate design decision.</p>
		<h4>User Accounts</h4>
		<p>A user account consists of only three fields: the internal ID of the user, the
			username, and a password (which has been hashed using SHA-256). No other
			personally identifying information is captured, not even an e-mail address.
			This has a number of implications; for example, the only way a password can
			be reset if the user forgets his password is to make a request from another
			device.</p>
		<h4>Devices</h4>
		<p>Associated with each user is one or more devices. A device is identified by a
			unique identifier (generated by the device using a cryptographically generated
			random number) and an RSA public key. When a user is sent a message, the sending
			client must download the public key for all devices the user owns, and separately
			encrypt the message each time for each device.</p>
		<h4>Message Queue</h4>
		<p>Associated with each device is a separate message queue. This is used to temporarily
			store messages for devices that are not on-line. Messages are then delivered to
			devices that go on-line, and removed when the device successfully acknowledges
			receipt of the message.</p>
		<img class="diagram" src="images/sendmessage.png">
		<p>When a message is sent to a user, the first thing the client does is obtain a
			list of devices associated with a user. Then the client encodes the message
			using the public key of each device the message is being sent to. Finally the
			message is uploaded to the server, and the server notifies all devices which
			received a message. Once the message is delivered to a device, the device responds
			to the server to delete the message.</p>
		<h4>Server block diagram</h4>
		<img class="diagram" src="images/serverdiagram.png">
		<p>In addition to serving as a public key directory for owned devices, the server
			has the ability to handle direct socket connections from a client, so that 
			messages sent to the server can be immediately relayed to an on-line client.
			This is an optional service; if the server environment does not permit a socket
			from being opened to receive non-HTTP connections, the client will default to
			polling the server for messages on a 15 second interval.</p>
		<p>The server also contains calls for new membership onboarding, updating the
			user password, and for managing devices associated with a user.</p>

			Architecture</a> page.</p>
			
		<h3>Client Overview</h3>
		<p>Because the client is responsible for far more than the server, the client is
			necessarily more complex. Besides the <a href="rsa.html">custom RSA code</a>,
			the client consists of a number of other components used for managing the public
			and private key, for communicating with the back-end, and for storing and 
			managing messages.</p>
		<img class="diagram" src="images/clientblock.png">
		<p>Elements of the client code include:</p>
		<ul><li><b>Message Queue</b> which is responsible for sending and receiving messages,
			and for organizing messages.</li>
			<li><b>Message Database</b> which is responsible for saving and loading encrypted
			messages to a SQLite database,</li>
			<li><b>Device Cache</b> which caches the devices associated with a user,</li>
			<li><b>Message Decryption Cache</b> which caches in memory decrypted messages
			received from the server,</li>
			<li><b>Message Delete Queue</b>, which handles requests for deleting messages,</li>
			<li><b>Network Client</b> responsible for sending requests to the back end,</li>
			<li><b>RSA Manager</b> which provides a single mechanism for managing the
			public/private RSA key for this application, as well as the user credentials and
			decrypting received messages,</li>
			<li><b>RSA Encoder</b> which handles encoding messages using a public key,</li>
			<li>and the various UI elements responsible for the look and feel of the 
			application.</li></ul>
