		<h1>Installation Instructions</h1>
		<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
		<p>The SecureChat client was built using Xcode; details can be found on the 
			<a href="setup.html">client setup page.</a></p>
		<p>The SecureChat server was built using Eclipse and using GWT. (Yes, I know,
			I don't really use GWT; it simply provides a good environment for rapidly
			developing a Tomcat-based server application.</p>
		<p>What you need (or rather, what I used):</p>
		<ul><li><a href="http://eclipse.org">Eclipse.</a> (I used v4.5.1, the Mars.1 Release)</li>
		<li><a href="http://gwtproject.org">GWT and the Eclipse plugin.</a> The version should
		not matter; I used GWT version 2.7.0.</li></ul>
		<h2>Setting up the database</h2>
		<p>First, you need to install the <a href="http://postgresql.org">PostgreSQL server</a> 
			on your server and set up an empty database and database credentials. This 
			differs between different systems and in some cases PostgreSQL may be 
			pre-installed for you if you are using a third party hosting system. So the steps 
			for installation are left to your own devices.</p>
		<p>Once installed you need to create a project file which contains the connection
			information for connecting to your PostgreSQL server. That file should look like
			the one below (which can be used as a template):</p>
		<pre class="samplecode"># Database connection properties
dburl = jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/ss
username = postgres
password = secretpassword

# Notification connection properties
# notifications = no
hostname = myserver.com
hostport = 1348

# notificationssl = yes
keystorefile = /path/to/keystore.jks
keystorepassword = password</pre>
		<p>This file can then be copied into a known location on your server. It can be
			located in one of the following places:</p>
		<ul><li>/home/s/securechat.properties</li>
			<li>~/.warconfig/securechat.properties</li></ul>
		<p>where '~' represents the home directory returned by examining the system
			property "user.home".</p>
		<p>If the file has to be located somewhere else, you may do so, but you will then need
			to modify the source code (described below) to obtain the properties file.</p>
		
		<h2>Building the system</h2>
		<p>Now you need to build the war file for installation.</p>
		<ul><li>If, while installing the securechat.properties file above, you had to
			install it at a different location than the default locations provided in the
			SecureChat system, you will need to modify the <b>Config.java</b> source file
			(located at <i>com.chaosinmotion.securechat.server.config</i>) with the correct
			location of your properties file.</li>
		<li>Examine the <b>build.xml</b> build file. The SDK for GWT on my system
			is installed at <i>/Applications/eclipse/sdk/gwt-2.7.0</i>; this is the Applications
			directory of the Macintosh I use for development. Edit the location to
			point to the location where you installed the GWT SDK.</li>
		<li>Run ant on the <b>build.xml</b> file. The default build should generate a war
		file called <b>securechat.war</b> next to the build.xml file.</li></ul>
		<h2>Notifications</h2>
		<p>Notifications require that the server be able to open an arbitrary port capable of
			receiving incoming connections. If your server is not capable of opening an
			arbitrary port, then you will want to modify the notification settings in your
			configuration file.</p>
		<p>There are a few possible values.</p>
		<p>If <b>notifications</b> is set to <i>no</i>, then notifications will be disabled
			for your server installation. This is useful in environments where a port cannot
			be opened, such as with hosting services that provide Tomcat services.</p>
		<p>If <b>notifications</b> is not set, then a notification port will be opened 
			and advertised via the notifications API.</p>
		<p>The hostname and port used by the notifications API is advertised at the 
			<b>hostname</b> and <b>hostport</b> parameters. If the values are not 
			provided, hostname will attempt to get the hostname of the server; otherwise, 
			it will be the hostname advertised.</p>
		<p>If the <b>hostport</b> parameter is not provided, then the server will attempt to
			open a random port. Otherwise the <b>hostport</b> value is interpreted as an
			integer, and used as the port for the notifications API.</p>
		<p>If you have a firewall that the server is behind, you must use the same port number
			on both machines, but the <b>hostname</b> value is simply passed to the API for 
			connection.</p>
			
		<h3>Securing Notifications using TLS v1.2</h3>
		<p>Notifications sends all messages encrypted, but the header is sent in plain text.
			So long as users pick names that cannot be easily traced back to them, this
			represents a minor security breach. But you can protect the data stream sent via
			notifications using SSL. (This is highly recommended.)</p>
		<p>To set up the certificate for SSL, you must first create a certificate. You can
			create a self-signed keystore by using the Java tool keystore:</p>
		<pre class="samplecode">keytool -genkey -alias keystore -keyalg RSA -validity 9999 -keystore (filename) -storetype JKS</pre>
		<p>You will be prompted for a keystore password, and for other information, including
			your first name, last name, etc. This information will be sent when someone
			attempts to connect to your server, and can be displayed using OpenSSL, so you
			may wish to consider spoofing the information. You may also generate a signed
			certificate; the way to do this is beyond the scope of this documentation.</p>
		<p>(Note: there are security problems with self-signed certificates, including making
			it far easier to engage in a man-in-the-middle attack. However, as all messages
			are sent encrypted, and removing a message from the back end requires successful
			decryption with the private RSA key, listening to messages is of relatively limited
			use.)</p>
		<p>To install the keystore, you use the <b>notificationssl</b> key, the <b>keystorefile</b>
			key, and the <b>keystorepassword</b> key:</p>
		<ul><li>The <b>notificationssl</b> key must be set to "yes".</li>
			<li>The <b>keystorefile</b> key must be set to the full path to the keystore file
			that you generated using the Java keytool program (above).</li>
			<li>The <b>keystorepassword</b> key must be set to the password specified when you
			generated the keystore file.</li></ul>

		<h2>Installing and verifying your system</h2>
		<p>Now you can upload the war file to a running Tomcat instance.</p>
		<p>If you do not have Tomcat running on your server, you will need to 
			<a href="htp://tomcat.apache.org">download and install it to your server.</a>
			Because the requirements from hosting service to hosting service varies, the
			specific steps are left to your imagination.</p>
		<p>Once Tomcat is running you upload the war file using the Tomcat manager (or 
			the Tomcat manager that was provided for you, such as CSI Probe.</p>
		
		<p>Once installed, you can verify the installation by connecting to the verify
			servlet. For example, you would connect with your browser to the following
			URL, assuming you installed SecureChat on Tomcat as "SecureChat":</p>
		<ul><li>http://myserver.com/SecureChat/ss/v</li></ul>
		<p>If all is running well, you should see the following response:</p>
		
		<pre class="samplecode">Validating
DB: jdbc:postgresql://myserver.com:5432/securechatdb -- Success: schema version 1.
Client path: http://myserver.com/SecureChat
(Client path is what the user uses when prompted for a server URL.)
Notification service running on myserver.com:1348
<i>SecureChat Copyright © 2016 William Edward Woody.</i></pre>

		<p>If the notification service has a keystore, this will be indicated in the message
			displayed during validation.</p>
