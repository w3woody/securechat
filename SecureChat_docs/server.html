		<h1>Server Overview</h1>
		<p>This provides an overview of the SecureChat server source kit, including the
			database components, servlet components and notification service.</p>
		<h2>Design Goals</h2>
		<p>The SecureChat server is deliberately designed to be as minimal as possible,
			serving principally as a public key keystore and a message queue for sending
			and receiving messages between chat clients.</p>
		<p>The principle design goal for the SecureChat server is to reduce exposure to a
			hacker or agency from capturing message data or useful metadata through the
			following techniques:</p>
		<ul><li>Do not associate user account information with personally identifying
			information. The server only captures a username and password, and associates
			device identifiers (which are deliberately anonymous unique identifiers)
			with each device.</li>
			<li>Minimize the amount of data captured for each device. The SecureChat server
			only stores the device identifier and public RSA key for each device associated
			with the user.</li>
			<li>Only store messages in encrypted format. The messages handled by the 
			SecureChat server are all encrypted with the destination device's public key, 
			and can only be decrypted on the device using the private key for that 
			device.</li></ul>
		<p>These design goals make the server very simple: as no identifying information needs
			to be stored, the server database schema is quite simple:</p>
		<img class="diagram" src="images/serverdb.png">
		<p>The protocol used by the server to communicate with the client is also equally
			simple, and is <a href="network.html">documented separately.</a></p>
		<h3>Limitations</h3>
		<p>The current SecureChat server is not designed to scale to handle a large number
			of users, but to describe a system which can better protect communications
			between a smaller number of users. To scale some changes would need to be made
			to the way messages are stored in the database and to the way notifications
			would be handled.</p>
		
		<h2>Server Source Overview</h2>
		<h3>Configuration</h3>
		<p>The class <b>Config</b> <i>(com.chaosinmotion.securechat.server.config)</i>
			provides a standard mechanism for loading a configuration
			file for identifying the database and database credentials. This class looks
			for the securechat.properties file from the following locations, in order:</p>
		<ul><li>/home/s/securechat.properties</li>
			<li>~/.warconfig/securechat.properties</li></ul>
		<p>You need to modify this class if you need to store the configuration file at a
			different location.</p>
		<p>The format of the configuration file is as follows:</p>
		<pre class="samplecode"># Database connection properties
dburl = jdbc:postgresql://<i>hostname</i>:<i>port (i.e., 5432)</i>/<i>database</i>
username = <i>postgresql username</i>
password = <i>postgresql password</i></pre>
		
		<h3>Database</h3>
		<p>The SecureChat server by design expects to communicate with a 
			<a href="http://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a> database. The configuration is
			obtained from the configuration settings above.</p>
		<p>When first started, the class <b>DatabaseBuilder</b> verifies that a version table 
			is present in the database, and uses that to read the current version of the
			schema stored in the database. This then is used to determine which of the
			<i>schema<b>N</b>.sql</i> files are read to initialize the database schema.</p>
		<p>This design allows us to incrementally upgrade the server in the future; on startup,
			each <i>schema<b>N</b>.sql</i> file contained in the package 
			<i>com.chaosinmotion.securechat.server.database</i> is read, starting with the
			first unread schema file determined by the version number stored in the version
			database. This implies that each schema file contains the changes from the previous
			schema to update to the current version.</p>
			
		<h3>RSA Support</h3>
		<p>The package <i>com.chaosinmotion.securechat.rsa</i> contains a <a href="rsa.html">
			subset of the classes described on the client front end</a> to perform RSA 
			encoding and key management. This is used to allow the server to send admin 
			messages to each device in response to admin events.</p>
		
		<h3>Servlet Interface</h3>
		<p><a hef="network.html">Network requests</a> received by the SecureChat server are
			received by the classes declared in <i>com.chaosinmotion.securechat.server,</i>
			which parse the incoming POST requests, determine if the user is authenticated to
			make the call, and calls the appropriate command class (described below) to
			actually handle the command. There are three servlets which handle each of the
			three groups of network requests: <b>LoginServlet</b> handles requests to the
			/login URI, <b>DeviceServlet</b> for /device and <b>MessageServlet</b> for 
			/messages requests. A fourth servlet, <b>ValidateServlet</b> is used to determine
			if the SecureChat server has been set up correctly and to help identify the
			correct URL for chat clients to use.</p>
		<p>This uses the <a href="http://json.org">JSON parser library for Java</a> for 
			parsing incoming requests. Responses are also constructed using the classes
			defined in <i>com.chaosinmotion.securechat.server.json</i>, including standard
			error responses and the more complex response payloads.</p>
		
		<h3>Commands</h3>
		<p>The <i>com.chaosinmotion.securechat.commands</i> package contains the individual
			classes which handle each of the 11 major network requests that a client can make.
			This is the "business logic" of the SecureChat server.</p>
		
		<h3>Message Queue</h3>
		<p>The logic for handling sending messages to a specific user is handled by the 
			<b>MessageQueue</b> class contained in 
			<i>com.chaosinmotion.securechat.server.messages</i>. This class contains logic for 
			identifying a device from the device's UUID, for inserting a message into the
			database, and for sending out a notification to all devices that are listening for
			notifications. This also contains the logic for sending an admin message when the
			user requests to reset his password, and can by extension be used to extend the
			types of admin messages sent in the future.</p>
		
		<h3>Notifications</h3>
		<p>Notifications allow a chat client to immediately receive a message when a sender
			sends them a chat message. The notification mechanism used by SecureChat involves
			each client connecting to an advertised TCP/IP socket, logging into that socket,
			and then receiving messages as they are enqueued by the <b>MessageQueue</b> class.</p>
		<p>The code which listens for incoming requests is <b>NotificationService</b>, which
			uses Java sockets to create a socket listener; individual connections are managed
			by <b>NotificationSocket</b></p>
