		<h1>Client Overview</h1>
		<p>This document gives an overview of the SecureChat iOS client's source kit.</p>
		<h2>Design Goals</h2>
		<p>The fundamental design goal of SecureChat was to have all messages encrypted using
			RSA public/private key encryption entirely end-to-end. This means that at no time,
			except when a sender is composing a message, and when the receiver is displaying
			the message, do messages exist except in encrypted form using RSA encryption.</p>
		<p>By doing this, it is assumed that it would be impossible for an attacker or a third
			party agency from decrypting the messages or reconstructing a conversation without
			having access to a device-specific private key.</p>
		<p>To achieve this goal of security, a lot of weight is placed on the client's ability
			to generate and use a secure RSA public/private key architecture, relying on the
			server only to obtain public keys for destination devices, and for obtaining stored
			messages.</p>
		<p>To achieve this goal:</p>
		<ul><li>The client is responsible for generating its own public/private RSA key, which
			lives with the device.</li>
			<li>The RSA key (as well as other parameters necessary to contact the server) are
			encrypted using Blowfish, using an encryption key generated from a passcode 
			entered by the user.</li>
			<li>In order to reduce the risk of a brute force attack to find the encoded RSA
			key, the checksum used to validate if the data was correctly decrypted is
			deliberately weak; by using a CRC-8 checksum there is a 1 in 256 chance of a
			false positive, meaning for a 4 digit password an attacker is 39 times more
			likely to enter the wrong passcode, which results in destructively overwriting
			the RSA private key for the device.</li>
			<li>All messages stored on the device are stored in their encrypted format. To
			see the messages on the device, the correct passcode must be supplied for the RSA
			private key to be revealed, so that messages can then be decrypted. Decrypted messages
			are only held in RAM.</li></ul>
		<p>For the purposes of this application, we also make a few assumptions about the 
			Apple iOS operating system which are presently not true, but which are threatened
			by the current Apple v FBI squabble:</p>
		<ul><li>The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Security/Reference/keychainservices/index.html">Apple Keychain</a> API will be compromised by a
			subsequent ruling by the U.S. government or by another agency. We do use the
			iOS Keychain for secure storage of our keys, but we further encrypt the data
			we store there as described above.</li>
			<li>The Apple API call <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Security/Reference/certifkeytrustservices/index.html#//apple_ref/c/func/SecKeyGeneratePair">SecKeyGeneratePair</a> 
			will be compromised to generate weak public/private RSA keys or to transmit those
			keys via a side channel. This is why we <a href="rsa.html">roll our own RSA
			implementation.</a>.</li></ul>
		<h2>Important Note</h2>
		<p><b><u>Please note:</u></b> I have <b><i>absolutely no reason</i></b> to believe that
			any of these API calls have been compromised, and I am of the very strong opinion
			that Apple has best security practices in mind, as well as the consumer in mind,
			as they designed these calls. The fact, for example, that on iOS it seems (as of
			this writing) to be impossible to extract the private RSA key from a keychain,
			suggests to me Apple's interest in insuring best security practices.</p>
			<p>The purpose of this exercise is to assume <u><i>what if?</i></u>, and to provide a
			demonstration that it is possible for an individual, only equipped with a couple
			of books and some Wikipedia articles, to implement a secure chat system, and that
			this level of security is not the province of large corporations or nation-states.</p>
			
		<h2>SecureChat Client Source Overview</h2>
		<p>There are several modules which comprise our SecureChat client.</p>
		<h3>RSA Implementation</h3>
		<p>The custom implementation of the RSA encryption system is <a href="rsa.html">
		documented elsewhere in this document.</a></p>
		<p>To summarize, the classes and functions they provide are listed below:</p>
		<ul><li><b>SCUUIDGenerator</b> provides a generator for generating entirely random
			(version 4) 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">UUID keys</a>
			for identifying devices with the server.</li>
			<li><b>SCBlowfish</b> provides a 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_(cipher)">Blowfish encryption</a>
			class, and is used to encrypt and decrypt the keystore data for a device.</li>
			<li><b>SCRSAEncryption</b> provides the implementation of the RSA public/private
			key generator. The header also defines the <b>SCRSAKey</b> class for manipulating
			public and private RSA keys, and <b>SCRSAPadding</b> for encoding and decoding
			message blocks using an 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_asymmetric_encryption_padding">OAEP-style</a>
			padding scheme.</li>
			<li><b>SCChecksum</b> provides an implementation of the CRC-8 checksum algorithm.</li>
			<li><b>SCSecureHash</b> provides an implementation of the SHA-256 hash 
			algorithm.</li>
			<li><b>SCBigInteger</b> and <b>SCMontMath</b> provide big integer math routines used
			by the RSA algorithm.</li></ul>
		<p>In addition, the following classes assemble these into a more useful form:</p>
		<ul><li><b>SCRSAManager</b> provides the entry points for generating, managing and using
			the public and private key for this device, as well as storing credentials for 
			accessing the SecureChat server.</li>
			<li><b>SCRSAEncoder</b> provides a mechanism for encoding messages using a public
			key (supplied in <b>SCRSAKey</b>) using the padding scheme implemented in 
			<b>SCRSAPadding</b>.</li>
			<li><b>SCKeychain</b> provides a simple interface for reading and writing data
			into and out of the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Security/Reference/keychainservices/index.html">iOS Keychain</a>.</li>
			<li><b>SCSecuredData</b> provides a class to serialize and deserialize data stored
			by <b>SCRSAManager</b> into the keychain.</li></ul>
		
		<h3>Network Connection</h3>
		<p>The principle class used to make requests and get responses from the HTTP API used
			by the SecureChat server is <b>SCNetwork.</b> This class provides a series of
			standardized request interfaces for building and sending a JSON request, and
			for providing a callback when a response is received.</p>
		<p>The SCNetwork class takes a delegate (defined as <b>SCNetworkDelegate</b>) which
			is implemented by the <b>AppDelegate</b> for notifying when a network request is in 
			progress, for showing server errors, and for requesting connection credentials in 
			the event the network connection's authentication expires. The callback even 
			allows for a login screen to be displayed in the event the stored password is 
			incorrect. (All this is handled in the <b>AppDelegate</b> class.)</p>
		<p>The typical function call made to the back end looks like the code below, which 
			is taken from the code which handles a forgotten password:</p>
		<pre class="samplecode">NSDictionary *d = @{ @"token": self.token,
                     @"password": newPassword };

[[SCNetwork shared] request:@"login/updateforgotpassword" 
             withParameters:d 
                     caller:self 
                   response:^(SCNetworkResponse *response) {
    if (response.success) {
        /* Do something good */
    }
}];</pre>
		<h3>Message Queue</h3>
		<p>The message queue code and related classes handles messages that were sent and
			received from the SecureChat server.</p>
		<p>The principle class is <b>SCMessageQueue</b>. This class handles a background
			thread or timer mechanism to listen for incoming messages, to obtain the messages
			received from local storage, and to send messages to a remote receiver.</p>
		<p>Note that the message queue is not started until the passcode is unlocked and
			the credentials and remote server address correctly decoded. The message queue
			is also paused when the application goes inactive. The <b>SCMessageQueue</b>
			class also handles notifications received from the server, and polls if 
			notifications could not be set up.</p>
		<p>Storage of the messages is handled by the <b>SCMessageDatabase</b> class, which
			wraps <a href="http://sqlite.org">SQLite</a> for storage. Messages are stored as
			raw encoded bytes; they are decrypted (and cached in memory) using the 
			<b>SCDecryptCache</b> class, which maintains a temporary in-memory cache of
			decrypted messages.</p>
		<p>When a message is sent, one of the first things that needs to be done is to resolve
			all the devices associated with both the sender and the receiver of the message.
			This is handled by <b>SCDeviceCache,</b> which provides a cache of the devices
			associated with a user. Entries in this cache expire every 5 minutes. One
			implication of this design is that an existing user adding a new device to the
			list of his devices may have to wait five minutes before messages are received
			on this device, as other clients expire their device cache.</p>

		<p>Received messages are removed from the server after they are decrypted. This is
			handled by the <b>SCMessageDeleteQueue</b> call. Messages are identified by their
			<i>messageID</i>; duplicate messages are detected and removed without showing
			up as duplicates in the local chat database or display.</p>
