		<h1>Client Setup</h1>
		<p>This covers the steps for building and deploying a client, as well as setting up
			the client device for chatting.</p>
		<h2>Requirements</h2>
		<p>The SecureChat iOS client was built with Xcode v7.</p>
		<h2>Building</h2>
		<ul><li>Open the <b>SecureChat.xcodeproj</b> file in Xcode. SecureChat has no other
			dependencies.</li>
		<li>Build the application. You will need an Apple Developer account in order to install
			the application on your iOS devices; the type of account will determine what limits
			on the number of devices you have during installation.</li></ul>
		<h2>Setting up a running client.</h2>
		<p>All of the steps for setting up the client, as well as steps for adding a new device,
			for changing the password, and for unregistering a device, are handled through a
			series of "wizard"-like screens which should help you set up your device. The
			process should be self-explanatory.</p>
		<h3>Onboarding Steps</h3>
		<p>The steps used when starting up a client are outlined below. You must complete these
			steps prior to using the application.</p>
		<h4>Select a Passcode</h4>
		<p>A passcode is a sequence of digits which is used to generate an encryption key for 
			encrypting the contents of the keystore used to store your RSA key. The longer the
			sequence, the more secure your keystore and the messages on your device. The
			sequence must be at least 4 digits long.</p>
		<h4>Generate an RSA Key</h4>
		<p>All messages sent and received by the device are sent and received using RSA. The
			longer the RSA key, the more time it takes to generate a key and to encrypt and
			decrypt messages. In general a 1024 bit key is good enough, but if you are willing
			to wait longer, you can pick a 2048 bit key or a 4096 bit key. Note that a
			2048 bit key can take up to 2 minutes to generate, and a 4096 key can take several
			minutes.</p>
		<h4>Select SecureChat Server URL</h4>
		<p>This will depend on where the SecureChat server was installed. You will need to
			obtain this URL from the person who installed the server. By default the URL
			is assumed to be https://, unless specified otherwise.</p>
		<p>For example, if the server was installed at http://myserver.com (and that is the
			URL returned during installation), you may enter:</p>
		<p><b>http://myserver.com</b></p>
		<p>If the server was installed with https://, you can instead enter:</p>
		<p><b>myserver.com</b></p>
		<p>If the wrong URL is entered or the server is not present, you will get an error.</p>
		<h4>Create an account or log into an existing account</h4>
		<p>If you have an existing account you may enter the credentials. If you have forgotten
			your existing account's password, you can request to reset the password, but note
			this will only work if you have a device currently registered to that account. 
			(Password reset requests are broadcast to devices currently registered to the
			account, as there are no e-mail addresses stored for each user account.)</p>
		<p>Creating an account only requires a username (which you should select in a way
			which does not identify yourself; i.e., don't use your name), and a password. The
			password must contain at least 8 letters, including one capital letter, one
			lowercase letter, one digit and one punctuation character.</p>
		<p>Note that all passwords are hashed, and are not stored in clear text.</p>
		
		<h4>Done!</h4>
		<p>Enjoy securely chatting with other users!</p>
		
		<h2>Maximizing Security</h2>
		<p>Here are some steps you can do to make sure the security of your messages are
			maximized.</p>
		<h3>Account Security</h3>
		<ul><li>Pick a username which does not identify who you are.</li>
			<li>Pick a secure password that cannot be easily guessed.</li>
			<li>Never share your password with anyone. The SecureChat password is hashed, so
			there is never any need to share your password, and there is no way for others
			to inspect the server to discover your password.</li></ul>
		<h3>Device Security</h3>
		<ul><li>Pick a good passcode, one that is hard to guess (like your birthday), but
			one which is easy for you to remember.</li>
			<li>Never share your device with anyone.</li>
			<li>Always pay attention to the number of devices SecureChat thinks you have
			registered to your account. If that number does not match the devices you think
			you have, discontinue using your account immediately.</li></ul>
		<h3>Secure chatting</h3>
		<ul><li>Pay attention to the number of devices registered to the person you are
			chatting with. If that number suddenly jumps, you may want to contact that
			person separately and ask them if they've added a new device to their 
			account.</li></ul>
