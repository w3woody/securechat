		<h1>SecureChat Introduction</h1>
		<p>SecureChat is a secure chat application which is designed to minimize the
			opportunity for third party agencies (such as hackers or governmental agencies)
			from being able to obtain chat history or chat messages from a compromised server.</p>
		<p>This is done through a design which does the following:</p>
		<ul><li>Encrypts all messages sent to the server using a public key/private key architecture.</li>
			<li>Removes all messages from the sever as they are read by a client.</li>
			<li>Captures no personally identifying information, either with account setup or with device registration.</li></ul>
		<p>This also attempts to secure the iOS chat client via the following techniques:</p>
		<ul><li>Uses a weak checksum to verify the correct device code is entered, giving a 1 in 256 chance the wrong password will destructively load the internal private key.</li>
			<li>Stores all messages on the device encrypted; thus, simply copying the data from the device without the private key is useless.</li>
			<li>Assumes the RSA algorithms on the device have been compromised by providing a custom implementation of RSA key encryption.</li>
			<li>Assumes the keystore on the device has been compromised by requiring a separate passcode to decode internal data.</li></ul>
			
		<p><b><u>Please note:</u></b> I have <b><i>absolutely no reason</i></b> to believe that
			the Apple keychain or encryption services have been compromised, and I am of the 
			very strong opinion that Apple has best security practices in mind.</p>
			
			<p>The purpose of this exercise is to assume <u><i>what if?</i></u>, and to provide a
			demonstration that it is possible for an individual, only equipped with a couple
			of books and some Wikipedia articles, to implement a secure chat system, and that
			this level of security is not the province of large corporations or nation-states.</p>

		<p>Also note that I am not providing an implementation of this system for public use. That
			is, I am not running a publicly available SecureChat server, nor am I providing
			the iOS app on the App Store. Instead, this is intended to be a demonstration of
			how an individual can provide a secure chat system by providing a sample
			implementation.</p>

		<h2>Documentation.</h2>
		<ul><li><a href="toc.html">Table of Contents</a></li></ul>
		<p>Beyond publishing this software as open source, this document serves as an overview
			of how the software works. If you wish, you can compare the documentation here
			with the implementation of the client and server components to verify that the
			components act as they should. You are also welcome to examine the design in order
			to poke holes; I'm aware of a couple (which are described in their sections),
			and you may be able to find more on your own.</p>
		<h2>Why?</h2>
		<p>For me, this boils down to the 
			<a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/02/apples-fbi-battle-is-complicated-heres-whats-really-going-on/">Apple v FBI</a>
		clash, and more importantly, to the public rhetoric which surrounds that case.</p>
		<p>Over the past few weeks I've seen pundits and Presidential candidates opine that
			Apple was being traitorous, that Apple was being un-American, that Apple was out
			of line and needs to cooperate with the FBI regardless of the national or
			international ramifications.</p>
		<p>Worse, I've seen pundits completely mis-represent how encryption works (confusing
			it with a related concept of 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control_list">Access Control</a>),
			or stating that while they personally believed that their own information should
			not be exposed to hackers, the FBI must have access to <i>every last byte</i> on
			a suspect's device, regardless of how Apple has to engineer the operating system
			to provide that access. And if that means our personal private data is exposed
			to hackers or to other nation-states, then we'll "deal with that" when we get
			there.</p>
		<p>And, more to the point, I've seen pundits theorize that only large corporations and
			nation-states are capable of putting together secure end-to-end communications
			systems--and so regulating them and forcing them to comply with law enforcement
			would have few implications.</p>
		<p>Sorry, no.</p>
		<p>First, encryption is no longer the province of wealthy corporations and nation-states.
			Books such as 
			<a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/applied_cryptography/">Applied Cryptography</a>
			and <a href="http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/hac/">Handbook of Applied Cryptography</a> (the
			two reference books I used to implement the public key algorithm used here), along
			with articles on Wikipedia make it easy for any reasonably competent software
			developer with a little experience to assemble a system such as this.</p>
		<p><i>(That many cannot speaks more to the state of our industry than it does to the
			difficulty of the task.)</i></p>
		<p>Second, encryption is not a pixie dust which is sprinkled over an application to make
			it more secure. It is a way of thinking about the design of a system from end to end
			which makes it more secure. Encryption, in other words, is a way to think about 
			the design of an application.</p>
		<p>Think of your system as the plumbing of a house: pipes running throughout carrying
			water to a series of sinks and toilets and showers and household appliances. 
			Encryption is not like tape which can be wrapped around a leak to keep it from
			leaking. Security is a way to think about the entire plumbing, to make sure that all
			of the joints are tight and well installed, that certain pipes slant downhill (so
			sewer lines don't clog), that the right piping materials are used so you don't create
			future problems (such as tying in copper with steel without an insulating buffer).
			In that light, encryption is a tool, like plumber's tape, that helps with the
			overall design.</p>
		<p>And what the FBI wants is for Apple to poke holes in the piping in order to gain
			unprecedented access to communications that, just 30 years ago, was ephemeral
			and temporary in nature--and thus unavailable to agencies like the FBI.</p>
		<p>Now this wouldn't be so bad, if it weren't for the fact that for every terrorist
			there are <i><b>hundreds</b></i> of oppressed peoples around the world (such as
			LGBT activists and political activists seeking greater freedom for themselves)
			who rely on secure communications in order to coordinate their activities or simply
			to live a more fulfilling life with less fear of oppression by authorities 
			<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/07/iran-executes-men-homosexuality-charges">
				who make execution of homosexuals a public spectacle.</a></p>
		<p>So the idea that we should weaken this system of security, exposing millions of
			people to greater oppression around the world by setting 
			<a href="http://www.apple.com/customer-letter/">a dangerous precedent,</a> 
			in order to <i>slightly</i> simplify the law enforcement efforts of the FBI at 
			home--<b>what the fuck?</b></p>
		<p>And it's not even that many terrorists care about secure systems. The attackers
			in Paris, for example, 
			<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20151118/08474732854/after-endless-demonization-encryption-police-find-paris-attackers-coordinated-via-unencrypted-sms.shtml>">used unsecure SMS messages</a>
			to coordinate their attacks. The very lightening nature of coordinated terrorists
			attacks combined with the cell-like structure of terrorist organizations means that
			encryption is unnecessary for them to achieve their goals.</p>
		<h3>Code is Speech.</h3>
		<p>That's why I did this. 
			<a href="http://time.com/4248928/code-is-free-speech/">Because code is speech,</a>
			and nothing works better to demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of encryption 
			and secure chat systems than to build a system as a demonstration that such a 
			system can be built by a motivated individual using nothing but publicly
			available sources.</p>
		<p>There are no public secure chat system. I am running a private server for test
			purposes, but it has no traffic outside of my verifying the system works.</p>
		<p>I am certainly willing to work with any agency or corporation as a private
			consultant; if you wish to contact me shoot me an e-mail at 
			<a href="mailto:woody@alumni.caltech.edu">woody@alumni.caltech.edu.</a> And this
			is only a demonstration project, as it exists it is not capable of being
			extended to a large system, though it certainly could with some effort.</p>
