		<h1>Security</h1>
		<p>Of course this is not a complete list, but is a list of the potential strengths 
			and weaknesses of this design. With some effort many of these weaknesses 
			could be overcome.</p>
			<p>However, the point of this demonstration was not to make
			the "perfect" chat system, but to demonstrate (via software) the way such a
			secure chat system could be produced, which makes it difficult or impossible
			for third parties to examine the messages being sent and received, and difficult
			or impossible for someone with access to either a client or a server to
			reconstruct the sent and received messages.</p>
		<h2>Attacks on a client</h2>
		<p>Clients in SecureChat assume full responsibility for encoding and decoding messages
			sent to the SecureChat server. This makes them vulnerable if a third party hacker
			or agency got access to the data stored on that device.</p>
		<ul><li>All messages sent and received by a client are stored as RSA encoded 
			messages using the device's public key, in a <a href="http://sqlite.org">SQLite</a>
			database. Other fields in the SQLite database are not encrypted, which means 
			someone who scrapes the file system of a device will have access to metadata 
			associated with the chat application.</li>
			<li>Because a hacker or agency who wants access to the data on a device has
			access to the source code, it is not unreasonable to assume a determined hacker
			could build a variation which allows the passcode to be guessed and to determine
			based on attributes stored in the keystore to determine if the correct passcode
			was selected. <br><i>One solution would be to alter the way data is stored in the
			keystore so as to increase the entropy of the stored data, and to create a
			storage scheme for the public and private RSA keys so that an incorrectly
			entered passcode decrypts to a "valid" RSA key.</i></li>
			<li>Because all communications are stored on the client (and no backup copy is
			maintained on the server), loss of a device means loss of the chat history.</li>
			<li>Because there is no means to discover users to chat with, it is assumed the
			username is discovered through other, potentially unsecure channels.</li></ul>
		<h2>Attacks on the server</h2>
		<p>Because the server is used as a keystore for public keys and as a message queue
			for when devices are not on-line, there are several possible attacks on a
			server.</p>
		<p>One advantage of this architecture is that it is impossible based solely on the
			information on a server to determine which device belongs to which user, to 
			resolve a device identifier to an actual physical device, or (so long as user
			names are properly selected) to tie a username back to a user. Because messages
			are only stored until they are successfully delivered, and because messages are
			stored encoded on the back-end PosgreSQL database, it should be difficult to
			reconstruct old messages.</p>
		<p>However, there are some obvious potential attacks.</p>
		<ul><li>A "fake" device can be registered to each user which causes the client to
			encrypt each message to a third party-owned client. This would require
			the fake device to be inserted either into the source code or into the
			database.<br>
			<i>Note one way to work around this is by examining the number of devices that
			are registered to you and to the person you are sending messages from; if that
			number changes, contact the sender via a separate channel to see if he has added
			a new device.</i></li>
			<li>A dirtier trick would be for a hacked version of the server to announce a
			different public key for a specific device than the device published to the 
			server. Then the sender encodes for the 'fake' device, and the message is then
			decrypted using the fake private key, then re-encrypted to the destination
			device's public key.<br>
			<i>This is somewhat mitigated by having each device compare its own public key
			with the one announced by the server, and complaining to the user if the
			public key does not match.</i></li>
			<li>Each message waiting to be delivered is stored encrypted on the PostgreSQL
			server; however, other metadata is not encrypted (except passwords, which are
			hashed using SHA-256). This implies it is possible, assuming users do not regularly
			check for their messages, that some metadata can be recovered (helping to
			identify which users are communicating with which).<br>
			<i>This can somewhat be mitigated by making sure messages are read in a 
			prompt fashion, and perhaps having a timeout mechanism which automatically
			deletes messages older than a certain timeout threshold.</i></li></ul>
		<h2>Attacks on the network</h2>
		<p>There are a number of potential attacks that can be carried out on the network.</p>
		<p>In general, the classic categories of network attacks are sniffing for information,
			creating a 'man in the middle' which intercepts and perhaps either subtly modifies
			or records packets as they are sent, and 'reply attacks' which attempt to spoof
			a device by replaying previous messages. These are mitigated against, but are still
			worth noting.</p>
		<ul><li>Messages sent between the client and server are sent via HTTP. When installing
			the server it is recommended that an SSL/TLS key be created so messages are sent
			and received via HTTPS, in order to mitigate 'man in the middle' attacks and
			packet sniffing.<br><i>This can be additionally mitigated by creating a specifically
			formed SSL/TLS public/private signing key, and modifying the source code in the
			client to fail if a different public key is announced by the server. That way
			messages can neither be intercepted or a server endpoint spoofed.</i></li>
			<li>While messages sent out during notifications are being sent encrypted using
			the RSA encryption process on the sending client, the header is sent 'in the
			clear.'<br>
			<i>This can be mitigated by modifying the notification mechanism to SSL/TLS to
			encrypt the notification port, and by having the client connect using a secure
			socket connection.</i></li></ul>
		<h2>"Social" attacks.</h2>
		<p>Despite how hackers are portrayed in the press, magically typing away some weird
			commands and suddenly some light goes off showing they're "in", the reality is
			most hackers use "social engineering" to hack their way into a system. For example,
			notorious hacker Kevin Mitnick gained access to a number of sensitive files by
			dressing up and walking through the front door as a disoriented new employee.</p>
		<ul><li>Because there is no means for discovery and no way to correlate a user
			account with a specific person, you need to make sure the person you are
			communicating with is who they say they are. This means finding a trusted way to
			indicate the accounts to be used when chatting online.</li>
			<li>Beware of the one-word typo for usernames; replacing a zero with a capital 
			letter 'O', or replacing capital 'I' (<i>eye</i>) and lowercase 'l' (<i>ell</i>).</li>
			<li>Beware chat messages asking to change accounts without verifying with
			that person via another channel. Likewise, beware messages suggesting you
			change accounts first.</li>
			<li><b>Never give your password or your passcode to anyone.</b> Always use strong
			passwords and passcodes that cannot be easily guessed. And pick usernames which
			cannot be tied back to you.</li></ul>
